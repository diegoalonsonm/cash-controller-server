# CASH CONTROLLER (server)

Welcome to Cash Controller. This app is the best app available for you to keep track of your finances logging your incomes and expenses to maintain a positive balance each month. You would also see all your stats through charts so you can have a more visual understanding on how you are using all your money.

This repo hosts all the server code that's in the app. Here you can watch how I developed the app, the logic and notice the MVC architecture. 

The tech stack for the development process of the app is the following:
- Node Js (Express)
- MySql DB hosted in AWS using the RDS service
- Zod for validations
- MVC
